Today I learnt about Lighthouse, an open source, automated tool to measure the quality of webpage.
Web performance is a very important thing. By improving it, web's exposure to the world will get better. Better SEO optimization, less burden in hosting, and most importantly better user experience. But measuring web performance is a very subjective matter. What do we have to do to make our web perform better?

This is where lighthouse is used. Lighthouse automatically scan webpage that you want to check and give output scores ranging from 0-100 about the performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO of the webpage. The best part is we'll be given feedback to give ideas about things we could improve, such as resizing image, minimize main-thread works, and etc.

But even though we are given feedback about it, at the end of time, the feedback is just a rough idea about the problem. We still have to do it ourselves, and sometimes, the feedback given by lighthouse is just not enough. Lighthouse can't give us feedback about the structure/design pattern of our webpage. And I too, don't have that much experience regarding that. That's why I want to join DSC ITB. I want to have hands-on experience regarding building eficient web and apps. I believe DSC ITB will be a great learning experience for me.
